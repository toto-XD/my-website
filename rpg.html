        <h1>Khàla Alsarir</h1>
        <p>King Adruex Silvermane the second has been served his death sentence, 
            the Angel Syndrome has gripped his lungs and the Oracle of the Wintergrove has spelled death in his future. 
            Many years have passed since the colonies were established, far away from the homeland across the vicious serpent sea. 
            There they have blossomed, settlements filled with all manner of people. 
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>The military pushes the border further into the land, conquering more, reclaiming it in the name of the elven king of the East. </li>
                <li>The missionaries brings the Communion of the Holy Light to the savage peoples that reside here. </li>
                <li>The League of Arcane Inquiry gathers new and interesting ingredients for magical mixtures and items, all while exploring ancient ruins and uncovering magical secrets. </li>
                <li>The Gilded Ringers merchant guild establishes trade with the peoples here, and profits wildly in their mercantile efforts.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Venture across the seas, into the settlements and beyond, to discover what happened 10 000 years ago, in the darkest days of history!
